#Hello, my name is Eric Anderson
Thank you for visiting my page.

This is the start of a very exciting journey.  Have you ever dreamed of stepping into the abys with nothing more than the faith that the heros journey is more than a myth?  I can tell you I have, and I can now demonstrate the evidence of what this will bring.  Becoming a developere is something that has facinated me since my youth.  It is quickly becomming an all consuming passion and I am very proud of every piece of work I produce.  As I scratch and claw for every scrap of understanding in this arena, know that this does not come easy, not long ago, I started from zero, my work will continue to expand exponentially. It is a priviledge to work in such an excellent field of endeavor.
