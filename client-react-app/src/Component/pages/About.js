            Hello, my name is Eric Anderson Thank you for visiting my page. This
            is the start of a very exciting journey. Have you ever dreamed of
            stepping into the abys with nothing more than the faith that the
            heros journey is more than a myth? I can tell you I have, and I can
            now demonstrate the evidence of what this will bring. Becoming a
            developere is something that has facinated me since my youth. It is
            quickly becomming an all consuming passion and I am very proud of
            every piece of work I produce. As I scratch and claw for every scrap
            of understanding in this arena, know that this does not come easy,
            not long ago, I started from zero, my work will continue to expand
            exponentially. It is a priviledge to work in such an excellent field
            of endeavor.
