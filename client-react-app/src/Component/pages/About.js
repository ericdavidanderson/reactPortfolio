            Hello, my name is Eric Anderson. Thank you for visiting my page.  Have you ever stepped into the abys with nothing more than the faith that the
            heros journey applies to anyone willing to take the journey? If you have, you know that it is everything anyone has ever said it to be and more.  Learning to develop is something that has facinated me since my youth. So many of the functions that computers do can free up the human brain to discover the power of the human mind.  When humans learn to do this, nothing is impossible.  I am looking forward to working with those who use computers to expand the leading edge of creation.  If this statement ressonates with you, I would love to hear from you.
